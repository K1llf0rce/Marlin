# Note

I have switched to Klipper, so I'll archive this Repo for now as I don't plan on moving back to Marlin yet.

# Marlin for the original Anycubic i3 Mega

## The main thing about my builds is

- Support for ([FYSTEC V2.1 Mini12864 Display](https://wiki.fysetc.com/Mini12864_Panel/))

## What else to expect from my builds:

- Up to Date (at least I will try :P)
- TMC2208 for all axis except TMC2209 on Extruder (all reversed in software)
- Bang-Bang Hotbed Heating Method (instead of PID-Method)
- Linear Advance enabled (Default Value: 0; Doesn't work with TMC2208 on Extruder!)
- S-Curve Acceleration enabled
- BabyStepping enabled
- Manual Mesh Bed Leveling enabled
- Tweaked Junction Deviation and Acceleration (optimized for sharper corners, less ringing)
- Tweaked Step-Value for Extruder (set to underextrude a tiny bit)
- Tweaked default Hotend PID-Values

## Notes about Mesh Bed Leveling

After you went through the Leveling process, don't forget to adjust your Z-Offset accordingly and put the following in your start G-Code:
```
M501 ; load saved settings
M420 S1 ; apply mesh
```
Make sure to put it **AFTER** the G28 Homing Command!

## Big Thanks to

Please test this firmware and let us know if it misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!

## Contributors

Marlin is constantly improving thanks to a huge number of contributors from all over the world bringing their specialties and talents. Huge thanks are due to [all the contributors](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/graphs/contributors) who regularly patch up bugs, help direct traffic, and basically keep Marlin from falling apart. Marlin's continued existence would not be possible without them.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
